# The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

# 1.     1
# 2.     11
# 3.     21
# 4.     1211
# 5.     111221
# 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
# 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
# 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

# Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

# Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.


# Example 1:

# Input: 1
# Output: "1"
# Example 2:

# Input: 4
# Output: "1211"
